DATA-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
    
**Species**: Phytoplankton species used in the experiment. 
Cv = Chlorella vulgaris
Sq = Scenedesmus quadricauda
Ab = Ankistrodesmus braunii


**BPA_Concentration** (File 1); **BPA** (File 2): Experimental bisphenol A (BPA) concentration (mg/L)


**Temp**: Temperature (ºC)


**Triplicate** (File 1); Trip (File 2): Replicate number


**RFU** (File 1):Raw Fluorescence Units; Output from fluorometer used to determine population density and growth rate


**Day** (File 1): Day of experiment in which data was collected


**proportion_of_count** (File 2): Proportion of the total cell count of the community that was the specific phytoplankton species

**proportion_of_biovolume **(File 2): Proportion of the total biovolume of the community that was the specific phytoplankton species

**Total_BV**: Total biovolume (µm3) of 1 mL of the phytoplankton community


**bv_species**: Total biovolume of the particular species in 1mL of the phytoplankton community


**count**: Total cell count of the particular species in 1mL of the phytoplankton community


**avg_bv_per_count**: Average biovolume (µm3) of all cells of the particular species in 1 mL of the phytoplankton community
